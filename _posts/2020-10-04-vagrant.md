# Vagrant 설치
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads  

# Vagrant centos 시작
```bash
$ vagrant init centos/7
```

# Vagrant virtual box 구동
```bash
$ vagrant up
```

# Vagrant 종료
```bash
$ vagrant halt
```

# Vagrant 재시작
```bash
$ vagrant reload
```

# Vagrant ssh
```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```

# Vagrant root  
- vagrantfile  
```ruby
config.ssh.username = 'root'
config.ssh.password = 'vagrant'
config.ssh.insert_key = 'true'
```

# Vagrant share folder
- vagrantfile    
인자1 : [host os vagrantfile home]/share  
인자2 : vm 절대경로  
```ruby
config.vm.synced_folder "share", "/home/vagrant/share"
```

# Vagrant port forwording
```ruby
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
```

# Troubleshoting
1. window proxy 
    - 방법1. 환경변수에 http_proxy, https_proxy 설정
    - 방법2. vagrant-proxyconf 플러그인 설치 [https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf]  
        ```bash 
        $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf 
        ```
        vagrantfile 파일 수정  
        ```ruby
        config.proxy.http     = "http://yourproxy:8080"
        config.proxy.https    = "http://yourproxy:8080"
        config.proxy.no_proxy = "localhost,127.0.0.1"
        ```
    
1. Vagrant up 실행시 ssl certificate problem unable to get local issuer certificate   
    ```ruby
    config.vm.box_download_insecure = true
    ```
    혹은 vagrant 이미지만 먼저 로컬에 추가  
    https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search    
    ```bash
    vagrant box add --insecure centos/7 --insecure
    ```

        default: /home/vagrant/share => D:/000_dev/vagrant/workspace/centos7/share
    Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
    because the filesystem "vboxsf" is not available. This filesystem is
    made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
    Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
    guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
    Vagrant box. For context, the command attempted was:

    mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 home_vagrant_share /home/vagrant/share

    The error output from the command was:

    mount: unknown filesystem type 'vboxsf'

     One of the configured repositories failed (Unknown),
     and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only
     safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this:

         1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.

         2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working
            upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer
            distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the
            packages for the previous distribution release still work).

         3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled
                yum --disablerepo=<repoid> ...

         4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won't use it by default. Yum
            will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it
            again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage:

                yum-config-manager --disable <repoid>
            or
                subscription-manager repos --disable=<repoid>

         5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.
            Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,
            so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much
            slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice
            compromise:
