        default: /home/vagrant/share => D:/000_dev/vagrant/workspace/centos7/share
    Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
    because the filesystem "vboxsf" is not available. This filesystem is
    made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
    Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
    guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
    Vagrant box. For context, the command attempted was:

    mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 home_vagrant_share /home/vagrant/share

    The error output from the command was:

    mount: unknown filesystem type 'vboxsf'

    Vagrant failed to load a configured plugin source. This can be caused
    by a variety of issues including: transient connectivity issues, proxy
    filtering rejecting access to a configured plugin source, or a configured
    plugin source not responding correctly. Please review the error message

     One of the configured repositories failed (Unknown),
     and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only
     safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this:

         1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.

         2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working
            upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer
            distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the
            packages for the previous distribution release still work).

         3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled
                yum --disablerepo=<repoid> ...

         4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won't use it by default. Yum
            will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it
            again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage:

                yum-config-manager --disable <repoid>
            or
                subscription-manager repos --disable=<repoid>

         5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.
            Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,
            so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much
            slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice
            compromise:

                yum-config-manager --save --setopt=<repoid>.skip_if_unavailable=true
